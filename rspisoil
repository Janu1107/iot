CONNECTIONS: 
➢ Soil Moisture Sensor to Raspberry Pi: 
• VCC (Pin 1)  to Pin 1 (3.3V) 
• DATA (Pin 2) to Pin 11 (GPIO 17) 
• GND (Pin 4)  to Pin 6 GND 
PROGRAM: 
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO 
import time 
SENSOR_PIN = 17  # GPIO17 (Pin 11) 
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM) 
GPIO.setup(SENSOR_PIN, GPIO.IN) 
try: 
while True: 
if GPIO.input(SENSOR_PIN) == 0: 
print("Soil is wet") 
else: 
print("Soil is dry") 
time.sleep(1) 
except KeyboardInterrupt: 
GPIO.cleanup() 
OUTPUT: 
Soil is wet 
Soil is wet 
Soil is dry 
Soil is dry 
Soil is wet
