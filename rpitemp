CONNECTIONS: 
➢ DHT11 sensor to Raspberry Pi: 
• VCC (Pin 1)  to Pin 4 (5V) 
• DATA (Pin 2) to Pin 7 (GPIO4) 
• GND (Pin 4)  to GND 
PROGRAM: 
import Adafruit_DHT 
import time 
SENSOR = Adafruit_DHT.DHT11 
PIN = 4  # GPIO4 
while True: 
humidity, temperature = Adafruit_DHT.read(SENSOR, PIN) 
if humidity is not None and temperature is not None: 
print('Temp={0:0.1f}°C  Humidity={1:0.1f}%'.format(temperature, humidity)) 
else: 
print('Failed to get reading. Try again!')
